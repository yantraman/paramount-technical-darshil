**Discussion**

Please keep answers between 100 - 250 words per question below. Assume you are writing for a technical audience. Feel free to include hyperlinks to any external material as needed. 
1.	How you would approach this problem if each dataset was 100 GB instead of less than 100 MB per dataset like in the assignment. For each dataset type, how would you handle processing at this scale. How would your implementations change from this assignment? If you would choose different pipelines or tools, please discuss why you made those choices.

Apache Spark would continue to be an ideal choice for data processing. It is a big data framework that can work with large datasets using distributed computing. Ideally, a managed version of Spark such as Databricks or AWS EMR would be used to quickly configure and run Apache Spark. 
Apache Airflow would be ideal to orchestrate massive amounts of data. By adding staging directories and task dependencies, the pipeline can be managed and scheduled effectively. The more granular tasks with the staging directories would allow isolation for failed pipelines and incomplete final datasets. Instead of PostgreSQL, a more ideal datastore would be an MPP data warehouse like Snowflake. This will allow complex queries to scale quickly with the size of the data.  

2.	What about if you expected 10 GB of new data, for each source, daily, for the next year? For each dataset type, how would you handle processing at this scale. How would your implementations change this assignment? If you would choose different pipelines or tools than (1), please discuss why you made those choices. 

The existing data pipeline with PySpark and PostgreSQL should scale well for 10GB of data per day. Alternate to PostgreSQL, Snowflake can be used if all 10GB is stored in partitions by date on a single data warehouse. Another consideration would be to ensure that the database server can handle the increased data load. This may involve optimizing the database configuration, increasing server resources, or employing a distributed database setup if necessary. Partitioning the data in the database based on a suitable key, such as date or source, can improve query performance and parallelism during processing. Regular database maintenance tasks, such as index optimization and data archiving, may become more critical to manage the increasing data size over time. This is unnecessary with Snowflake or another data warehouse. If the pipeline needs to be in real-time, then the incoming data can be sent via Kafka with a publish-subscribe data ingestion model. However, this would be a completely different system than using PySpark for batch processing. 

3.	How would you go about deploying this solution to a production environment? Would you make any changes to the architecture outline above? Please discuss any anticipated methods for automating deployment, monitoring ongoing processes, ensuring the deployed solution is robust (as little downtime as possible), and technologies used. 

Deploying a large-scale data processing solution to a production environment involves several steps, including automating deployment, monitoring, and ensuring robustness and minimal downtime. 

Automating Deployment: The deployment process can be automated using technologies like Docker and Kubernetes. Docker allows you to package your application and its dependencies into a container, while Kubernetes helps manage and scale these containers. CI/CD tools like CircleCI, or GitLab CI/CD can automate deployment of Docker images to Kubernetes containers. 

Monitoring: Monitoring is crucial to ensure your application is running as expected and to help identify issues before they become critical. Apache Airflow has built-in task monitoring, which can be used to monitor tasks.

Robustness and Downtime: Implementing a multi-node setup with load balancing can ensure your application continues to run even if one node fails. However, this would only be required for Kafka-based pipelines. 

Technologies Used: Key technologies used in this architecture include Apache Kafka for real-time data ingestion, Apache Spark for data processing, Apache Airflow for workflow management, Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration, and Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.
